<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Airbag Inflators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pyrotechnic Inflators</li><li>Stored Gas Inflators</li><li>Hybrid Inflators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The airbag inflators market consists of three main types: pyrotechnic inflators, stored gas inflators, and hybrid inflators. Pyrotechnic inflators use a chemical reaction to rapidly produce gas upon deployment, offering quick inflation. Stored gas inflators utilize high-pressure gas stored in a cylinder, ensuring reliable and consistent performance. Hybrid inflators combine both methods, using gas generation from a chemical reaction along with stored gas for optimal inflation speed and capacity. Each type serves different safety and performance requirements in vehicles.</p></p>

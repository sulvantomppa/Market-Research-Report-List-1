<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The In-center Dialysis Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Peritoneal Dialysis</li><li>Hemodialysis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In-center dialysis machines primarily serve patients with kidney failure through two main types: peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis. Peritoneal dialysis utilizes the patient's abdominal lining as a filtration membrane, allowing for home-based treatment or in-clinic sessions. Hemodialysis, on the other hand, involves circulating blood through a machine that removes waste and fluid, typically administered in specialized centers. Both modalities cater to diverse patient needs and offer varying treatment regimes in the growing dialysis market.</p></p>
